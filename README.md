# h2lib-matlab
This repository contains an attept to provide partial bindings to H2lib
from MATLAB. The aim of this effort is to test some ideas on the implementation
of a rank structure cyclic reduction method for a particular class of 
QBD processes. 

Note that, in particular, it is very likely that the bindings will be 
incomplete and tailored to the particular needs that we have.
